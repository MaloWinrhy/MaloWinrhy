# 👋 Hey, I’m Malo Henry (aka Winrhy)

By day, I’m a hybrid board game designer at **Arkada Studio**. By night, I delve into **decentralized systems** and push **Rust** to its limits.

📍 **Here, you’ll find:**

* 🚀 **Personal projects & tech experiments**
* 🤝 **Open source contributions** to the community
* ☕ A fair amount of creative chaos, powered by strong coffee

## 🌐 Featured Project: EcoWeave

**EcoWeave** is an eco-friendly decentralized mesh networking framework I built. It’s designed to help developers create peer-to-peer applications without relying on centralized servers.

🔗 [Check the repo](https://github.com/EcoBlock-Network) | 🌍 Built with Rust & Dart

## 🔥 Currently Working On

[![Working on](https://img.shields.io/badge/Working%20on-Mesh%20Protocol%20%7C%20EcoWeave%20%7C%20Hybrid%20Games-brightgreen)](https://github.com/MaloWinrhy)

**🚀 Active Projects:**

* Building a **Gossip Protocol** system using the **Flutter–Rust Bridge**
* Updating **HLC\_id**, my Rust library for hybrid logical clocks
* Expanding **EcoWeave**, my eco-friendly decentralized mesh network library
* Developing a new **mesh networking** library entirely in Rust

**🎲 Arkada Studio Projects:**

* *Erune: Light and Darkness* – expansion to the Erune hybrid board game
* *Sifflard* – an ambiance-focused party game
* *Mindblob* – an icebreaker question game

☕ All this is fueled by copious coffee and a dash of crazy ideas.
