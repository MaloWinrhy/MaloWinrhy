# 👋 Hey, I’m Malo Henry (aka Winrhy)

By day, I design **hybrid board games** with [Arkada Studio](https://www.arkada.studio/).  
By night, I dive into **decentralized systems** and push **Rust** to its limits.

📍 Here, you’ll find:
- 🚀 **Personal projects & tech experiments**
- 🤝 **Open source contributions** to the community
- ☕ A fair amount of creative chaos, powered by strong coffee

## 🌐 Featured Project: EcoWeave

EcoWeave is my eco-friendly decentralized mesh network framework, designed to help developers build peer-to-peer apps without relying on centralized servers.

🔗 [Check the repo](https://github.com/EcoBlock-Network) | 🌍 Built with Rust & Dart

## 🔥 Currently Working On

[![Working on](https://img.shields.io/badge/Working%20on-Mesh%20Protocol%20%7C%20EcoWeave%20%7C%20Hybrid%20Games-brightgreen)](https://github.com/MaloWinrhy)

🚀 Active projects:
- Building a **Gossip Protocol system** using **Flutter-Rust Bridge**
- Updating **HlC_id**, my Rust library
- Expanding **EcoWeave**, my eco-friendly decentralized mesh network library
- Developing a new **mesh library** entirely in Rust

🎲 At **Arkada Studio**, I’m also working on:
- **Erune: Light and Darkness**
- **Sifflard**
- **Mindblob**

☕ Fueling all of this: way too much coffee and crazy ideas.
